Hi Team and Welcome to this Google Classroom.

Classroom name SSG ERA.
Subject Batch.

In this training video, we will be looking at a batch issue where a batch queue keeps restarting or freezing.

I have prepared a checklist of what we can check as part of our troubleshooting for this issue. Let's begin...


what to check.

1.	If the batch job gets aborted, the system will try to restart the batch; however, if it fails, the batch will appear "stopped" in 6 9 8 3 screen.

2.	check the BATCH dot LOG file size in unix. Is the file over it's 2GB limit?

3.	check the BATCH dot LOG pointers. Do this by running CHECK dot FILE dot POS in TCL.

4.	check how many records inside the log file by running COUNT BATCH dot LOG in TCL. This will give you an indication how much record it needs to read.

5.	Purging the BATCH dot LOG file. The purging normally done by the customer in 6 9 5 5 then option7. The customer can purge specific executables.

6.	Check who last accessed executable 6 9 5 5  by running LIST E X dot USAGE 6 9 5 5 in TCL. This will give us a list of users who last accessed 6 9 5 5.

7.	This issue can impact server load, so ensure the PID is closed properly - check in 63 10 to verify.

 
how to fix it.

The customer will need to purge the BATCH dot LOG file in 6 9 5 5. This will reduce the amount of records for the system to read, hence, addressing the issue of batch restarting and freezing.
